# DuckDuckGo

DuckDuckGo is a search engine that started as a reaction to the large amounts
of data that Google collects about its users. DDG uses the Google search
results but anonymizes your searches. For simple searches, DDG might guess what
you are after an show a special search result at the top. Many times it is not
necessary to leave the search page, increasing productivity.
